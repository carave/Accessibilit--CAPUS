1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,200
it may seem odd to study

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,600
thinkers who wrote over 2000 years ago.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,600
We don t study scientists from ancient

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,600
times, and we don't treat what they

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,100
thought as anything more than historical curiosity.

6
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:17,100
So why do philosophy courses spend so

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,900
much time on ancient greek philosophers?

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,600
There are two reasons why greek philosophy

9
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,900
is still relevant to us to day.

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,600
One is the nature of philosophy itself.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,900
Philosophy deals with the biggest and

12
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:34,900
most complex issues facing humanity, and

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,600
philosophical insights underpin all human endeavors.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,900
Because the questions considered by philosophy are

15
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,500
so large and complicated, philosophy itself is

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,900
a long conversation about those issues among

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,200
many people across many years.

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,300
Philosophers understand that philosophers of the

19
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,300
past, even the distant past, are

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,500
valuable resources for us today.

21
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,900
To compare past perspectives with our

22
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:06,600
own perspectives today helps us better

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,100
understand the questions we consider.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,200
The second reason we still study ancient greek

25
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,500
philosophy is that the thinkers of greek philosophy

26
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,000
laid down the foundation of not just philosophy,

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,200
but all of western civilization.

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,900
There have been many influences throughout

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,000
history on who we are today.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,300
But what greek philosophers wrote over 2000 years

31
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,700
ago contributed a surprising amount to everything that

32
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,700
has happened in the west since.

33
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,600
We know of several dozen philosophers from

34
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
ancient Greece, and covering them all can

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,500
easily fill whole books and university courses.

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,000
Two ancient Greeks stand out as significantly more

37
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,300
influential than the others, Plato and Aristotle.

38
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,500
For the past 2300 years, Plato and Aristotle

39
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,100
have been pillars of the western world.

40
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,500
Their two worldviews have often been in competition with

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,300
each other, but people, recognizing their significance, have tried

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,800
to blend their ideas as best they could.

43
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,400
The worldviews of Plato and Aristotle at

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
first seem foreign to us today.

45
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,300
But if you look more closely, you can see threads in

46
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,500
each of their philosophies that are woven into our social fabric

47
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,600
and to understand who we are, how we got here, and

48
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,000
how we can approach the problems we face today.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,700
Those are the reasons we

50
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,400
study ancient greek philosophy today.
